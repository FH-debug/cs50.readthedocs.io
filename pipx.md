# `pipx`

`pipx` is a command-line tool that lets you install and run Python-based command-line applications in **isolated environments**, avoiding conflicts with other Python packages or system dependencies.

Whereas [`pip`](pip) installs packages globally or into a virtual environment (which you typically have to manage yourself), `pipx` automatically creates and manages a separate environment for each installed tool, making it ideal for installing CLI utilities like `submit50`.

If you don't already have `pipx` installed, you can install it for

* [Linux](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/#on-linux)
* [macOS](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/#on-macos)
* [Windows](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/#on-windows)
