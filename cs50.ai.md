# CS50.ai

CS50.ai is an adaptation of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) for students and teachers at [cs50.ai](https://cs50.ai/); it's also built into [Visual Studio Code for CS50](https://cs50.dev/) at [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/). Otherwise known as the CS50 Duck, CS50.ai supports [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and is thus a "duck debugger," or `ddb` for short, an homage to [GDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger).

Whereas ChatGPT itself is all too helpful nowadays—all too willing to provide outright answers to problems—CS50.ai is designed to behave more like a good tutor, leading students toward answers rather than spoiling them outright. It aspires to provide students with "office hours" 24/7, approximating a 1:1 student-to-teacher (well, student-to-duck) ratio.

Across [CS50's courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/courses/), it is unreasonable (i.e., academically dishonest) to use AI-based software other than CS50's own (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, et al.) that suggests or completes answers to questions or lines of code, except when explicitly allowed by a course. But it is reasonable to use CS50's own AI-based software, including the CS50 Duck in [cs50.ai](https://cs50.ai/) and [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/).
